# Stock_Analysis
Green Stock Analysis

# Overview of Project

## Background
A client, Steve has information about specific stocks on a spreadsheet he would like analyzed for the years 2017 and 2018. His parents are passionate about green energy. However, without doing any research they have invested in a green energy stock with the ticker symbol DQ. Steve would like to analyze the stock for his parents as well as other green energy stock so he can help his parents diversify their portfolio. After receiving this initial analysis, Steve decided that he wants to expand the dataset and analysis to include the entire stock market over the last few years

## Purpose

The purpose of the project is to use VBA script to analyze stocks and automate the spreadsheets for the client 

The project sought to determine the following:
     1.	 The total daily volume and yearly return for DQ stock for 2017 and 2018
     2.	 The total daily volume and yearly return for 12 green energy stocks for the years 2017 and 2018
     3.	The total daily volume and yearly return for of entire stock market over the last few years.

The project sought to create the following
     1.	To create a button on the spreadsheet that will run the VBA when executed by the client
     2.	To create an input box that will enable the client to enter a specific year of stock analysis
     3.	To create an output box that show a pop-up message showing the elapsed run time for the script

## Summary

### Refactoring code 

#### Advantages 
   1	Refactoring VBA code takes fewer steps while making the code more efficient 
   2.	Refactoring VBA reduces the execution time of the macro created
   3.	It is easier to be understood but others


#### Disadvantages
   1.	A refactored code can be longer depending on its purpose longer and therefore more susceptible to errors.
   2.	It can easily break an already working code if the script is not thought of and followed through logically
